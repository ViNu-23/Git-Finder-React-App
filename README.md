## Technologies Used
React.js: The core library for building the user interface, allowing for the creation of reusable components.
React Router: Enables navigation and handling different views within the application.
Fetch API and Async Functions: Used for making asynchronous requests to the GitHub API to retrieve user information.
Axios: An HTTP client for making requests to the GitHub API, providing a more convenient interface for handling HTTP requests.

## Features
User Search: Users can input a GitHub user ID in the search bar, triggering a request to the GitHub API to fetch user details.
